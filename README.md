# ExpressJS-Node-Persist
A beginner's approach in dealing with Node Persist storage using ExpressJS.

After executing `npm install`, all node modules will reflect in your workspace.

Here our approach is to create a local storage database with details of students that we are going to post and to get them as a whole and according to a particular condition.

Created a POST request to send students into local storage.
Created a GET request to get all the students from the local storage.
Created a GET request to get a student with highest GPA.
Created a GET request to get a student whose ID matches with req.params.id
Created a GET request to handle invalid URL.
